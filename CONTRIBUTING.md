# Contributing

If you have any questions about [Verifier](https://github.com/Skelp/verifier) please feel free to
[raise an issue](https://github.com/Skelp/verifier/issues/new).

Please [search existing issues](https://github.com/Skelp/verifier/issues) for the same feature and/or issue before
raising a new issue. Commenting on an existing issue is usually preferred over raising duplicate issues.

Please ensure that all files conform to the coding standards, using the same coding style as the rest of the code base.
All unit tests should be updated and passing as well. All of this can easily be checked via command-line:

``` bash
$ mvn clean install
```

All pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.

Don't forget to add your details to the list of
[AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/Skelp/verifier/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) if you want your contribution to be recognized by
others. We will try to make sure that the `contributors` node within the POM is updated on each release to reflect this.
